## Application Technology

This full stack application uses React, Node.js, Python, Javascript, Postgresql and Django.

## Functional Overview

This full stack application is designed to allow users to remember in a quantifiable way events that hold significance to them. The users are able to create a note for themselves, a Mamoo, that makes a timestamp upon creation.  That timestamp is then used to present to the user in days how long it has been since that note was created.
